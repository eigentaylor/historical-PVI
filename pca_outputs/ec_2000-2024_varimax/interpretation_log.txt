Notes:
- Features with large positive loadings rise/fall together along that PC; large negatives move inversely.
- For margins datasets: positive = more Democratic relative to nation; negative = more Republican relative to nation.
- For EC datasets: positive loadings increase the share in those buckets; negatives decrease it.
